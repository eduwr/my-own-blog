Fernando de Noronha is a Brazilian archipelago. Its territory is considered part of the state of Pernambuco and it is located in the Atlantic Ocean 545km from the state capital Recife.

## Best time to visit

There is not a very bad time to visit Fernando de Noronha, but the best time to visit the islands is the dry season from August to January.

From December to March the waves are stronger because of the swell, so if you're a surfer you'll probably like it.

The rainy season is from March to July (April is the raniest month), probably the worst time to visit.

The average air temperature is about 26 ºC with very low thermal amplitude throughout the year. The sea temperature varia de 26 ºC a 28 ºC.

This characteristics have made Fernando de Noronha a year-round destination.

## How many days

I spent three full days in the island and it was possible to visit the main destinations. If you are the type of tourist that like to see literaly everything or spend some time to chill I recomend 5 full days.

## How to arrive

There are only two ways to access the islands, by boat or by plane.

Boats from Recife take only goods and there are no tourists routes by boat to Noronha. I found few information about boats taking tourists, so I don't think this is a suitable option.

The main island of Fernando de Noronha has an airport, this is the best way to get to the island. There are flights departing from Recife airport (REC) or São Paulo (all airports).

- Tip: try to sit in the left side of the airplane to arrive and in the right side to departure, this will grant you great aerial pictures of the island.

## Fees

### Environmental Preservation Fee (TPA)

Upon arriving at the airport, the first thing to do is pay the Environmental Preservation Fee (TPA in Portuguese). The prices are around R$ 87.71 per day but daily rate may increase in relation to the amount of time you want to stay. [Here](https://www.noronha.pe.gov.br/turPreservacao.php) there is a complete list of the prices. You can also pay online, but this is only possible if you have a Brazilian bank account. You can pay by credit or debit card on site.

### Access ticket to the National Marine Park of Fernando de Noronha

Most of the archipelago is located inside the National Marine Park, to access it you must buy the ticket which can be purchased [online](https://tickets.parnanoronha.com.br/home) or at the ICMBio visitor center. The prices are R$ 330,00 for foreingers and R$ 165,00 for Brazilians, valid for 10 days.
This ticket is required for many cool activities like scuba diving, hiking and access to Sancho beach, IMHO the most beautiful beach on the island.

## Activities

I'll try to summarize the best activities to consider, ofcourse you can feel free to research and take others.

### Rent a Buggy (R$ 450.00 per day)

This is not an activity sold by tourist agencies, but I strongly recommend doing it on the first day. Just rent a buggy, get a map (the internet connection in the island is terrible) and ride all the island. The sensation of liberty is revigorating. Remember to purchase the ticked to the National Marine Park, because some beaches are only accessible with this.

We did it in the first full day of our stay. We visited Praia do Sancho, Praia do Leão, Praia do Sueste, Praia do Forte, Praia da Cacimba do Padre, Bahia dos Porcos and in the end of the day we could watch the sunset on Mirador do Francês. All in the same day.

The buggy price was R$ 450,00 per day and we also had to fill it with R$ 100,00 of gas. There are also other options to rent like cars, motorcycles or electric bikes.

The buggys are very popular, so in the high seasons try to make a reservation.

### Ilha Tour (R$ 280.00)

I don't recommend this activity because you can do the same reting a buggy and the price is quite the same for a couple. This tour takes the whole day. It starts in the morning and ends in the end of the afternoon visiting the main postcards of the island.

### VIP Sunset (R$ 290.00)

This activity starts in the late afternoon and leaves from Praia do Porto, then the boat sails towards Cacimba do Padre beach. During the navigation you can venture out with the PlanaSub dive which consists of a snorkeling dive where you will be towed by the boat while holding a hydrofoil board. At the end you can enjoy the sunset and eat a fish barbecue.

### Scuba Diving Baptism (R$ 790.00)

This certainly was one of the best parts of the trip. Fernando de Noronha has a lot of awesome spots for scuba diving and the water is incredibly clear.

We made a reservation of this tour with [Atalaia](https://www.atalaianoronha.com.br). The whole team was very thoughtful and they made my wife and I fell very calm on our first dive with all the instructions that we need.

We could see a shark, one octopus, a sea turtle eating and a lot of colorful fishes and coral. The dive takes 30 min, it is like to entering in a totally different world.

During the dive the team take pictures and you can also make videos, the video prices were really high and the only way to get the photos is on the agency in the city.

> Note: Take a snorkel with you because the dives are separeted by groups and you can feel free to swim while other groups are diving. Action cameras are also allowed without the stick (some rummors that people were using the sticks to poke the animals).
